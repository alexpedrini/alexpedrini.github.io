      My research is embedded within the **[FEAST](https://feast-survey.github.io)** program, 
      which investigates how stellar feedback from massive stars shapes the surrounding 
      interstellar medium and influences galaxy evolution. I focus on the morphological 
      and physical characterization of star-forming regions in nearby galaxies, combining 
      observations from the **James Webb Space Telescope** and other facilities.

## The FEAST Program

![FEAST Logo](/assets/images/logoFEASTvec.svg){: .align-right width="200px"}

The **Feedback in Emerging extragAlactic Star clusTers (FEAST)** program 
combines multi-wavelength observations to study how stellar feedback — 
winds, radiation, and supernovae — disperses the surrounding gas and dust 
in young star-forming regions.  
My work within FEAST focuses on mapping and understanding these processes 
across different galactic environments.

## Mapping HII Regions and PDRs {#hii-pdrs}
I identify and map **HII regions** (ionized hydrogen) and **PDRs** (photodissociation regions) in nearby galaxies using tracers such as Hα emission and PAH features.  
These maps reveal how young stars shape the surrounding interstellar medium.

## Star Cluster Identification {#star-clusters}
Using high-resolution imaging from HST and JWST, I detect and classify young star clusters.  
This allows us to connect their properties to their environment and evolutionary stage.

## Spectral Energy Distribution Fitting {#sed-fitting}
I apply **SED fitting** to multi-wavelength photometry (UV to IR) to estimate ages, masses, and extinctions of clusters and regions.  
This is crucial for reconstructing the star formation history.

## SLUG Modelling {#slug}
I use **SLUG** simulations to model stochastic effects in stellar populations, compare them to observations, and understand cluster evolution.
