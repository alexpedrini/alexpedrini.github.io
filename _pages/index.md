I am a PhD student in the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University, exploring the mysteries of how stars form and how they shape their galactic environments.
My work spans scales from small molecular clouds to entire galaxies, using observations from the largest telescopes in space.
I combine these data with computer models to uncover the physical properties of young star clusters and the processes driving their evolution.
